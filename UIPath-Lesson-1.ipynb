    "RPA (Robotic Process Automation) is the technology that enables software 'robots' to carry out repetitive, rule-based digital tasks. Humans typically perform these tasks through the user interface, using the mouse and keyboard. RPA robots are capable of mimicking the human actions, and they are typically more accurate, faster, and more consistent at it.\n",

    "- **Side-by-side** - robots work behind the scenes while the human user maintains control of the mouse and keyboard.\n",
    "- **Interactive** - the user engages with robots before, during and/or after the execution.\n",
